""" Exercise 3: Message Passing and Distributed Mutual Exclusion
Objective:
To understand and implement message passing between distributed processes.
To implement a distributed mutual exclusion algorithm to manage resource access in a distributed system.
Part 1: Message Passing
Task 1: Implement a Simple Message Passing System
Description: Create a message passing system where multiple processes communicate with each other using Java sockets. Each process will send and receive messages.
Part 2: Distributed Mutual Exclusion
Task 1: Implement Distributed Mutual Exclusion Using Ricart-Agrawala Algorithm
Description: Implement a distributed mutual exclusion algorithm (Ricart-Agrawala) to ensure that only one process at a time can access a critical section.

Solution:
